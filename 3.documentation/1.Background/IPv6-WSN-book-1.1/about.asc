== About the Book

The "IoT in five days" book is in active development by a joint effort from both academia and industrial collaborators, acknowledging that the Internet of Things of the future will be built on top of scalable and mature protocols, such as IPv6, 6LoWPAN and IEEE 802.15.4.  Open Source Operating Systems as Contiki, with more than 10 years of history and actively supported by universities and research centers, have been paving the Internet of Things road since the early beginnings of Wireless Sensor Networks and M2M communication, enabling the new IoT paradigm.

The content of the book are Open Source as well, feedback and contribution is more than welcome!  Please engage visiting  https://github.com/marcozennaro/IPv6-WSN-book[IoT in five days GitHub repository]

The book has been developed in asciidoc, and it can be compiled from its sources to produce HTML, PDF, eBook and others formats.

The following are the authors who contributed to this book:

*Antonio Liñán* defines himself as _"an engineer at day, maker at night"_ (he would do both for free).
He has more than 8 years of experience,having worked in over than 20 projects of in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), Internet of Things (IoT) applications and embedded firmware development; employed at Zolertia as both senior R+D engineer and CTO, buf if you ask him he just _"makes things blink and chat"_.  In his free time he's normally
engaged in Coursera, collecting hardware platforms, dwelling in hackathons or preaching about GIT.  He has a Master at the University of Los Andes (Colombia), has worked in European Projects related to Smart Cities, Internet of Things and Security, and currently is a prominent contributor in severals Open Source communities, like the one focusing on Contiki.

*Alvaro Vives* loves technology, problem solving, learning and teaching. Doing these things he has become a consultant, a network and systems engineer, and a trainer. As a consultant, he has worked on projects in several countries, at ISPs, content providers, public organizations and enterprises. As a trainer, since 2006 has lectured at more than 46 workshops in 18 countries directed to ISPs, content providers, public organizations, enterprises as well as in events like LACNIC/LACNOG, SANOG, WALC, and ESNOG. As network and systems administrator he has been in charge of production networks and services in several companies using different technologies from a variety of vendors. At present, he is working with WSN and IoT as a consequence of the convergence of IPv6 and IoT.

*Antoine Bagula* obtained his doctoral degree in 2006 from the KTH-Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden. He held lecturing positions at StellenboschUniversity (SUN) and the University of Cape Town (UCT) before joining the Computer Science department at the University of the Western Cape in January 2014. Since 2006, He has been a frequent consultant of the UNESCO through its International Centre for Theoretical Physics in Trieste, Italy, the World Bank and other international organizations on different telecommunication projects. His research interest lies on the Internet-of-Things, Big Data and Cloud Computing, Network security and Network protocols for
wireless, wired and hybrid networks.

*Marco Zennaro* received his M.Sc. degree in Electronic Engineering from University of Trieste in Italy. He defended his PhD thesis on “Wireless Sensor Networks for Development: Potentials and Open Issues” at KTH-Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden.
His research interest is in ICT4D, the use of ICT for development. In particular, he is interested in Wireless Networks and in Wireless Sensor Networks in developing countries. He has been giving lectures on Wireless technologies in more than 20 countries.  He is coauthor of the book “Wireless Networking for the Developing World”.

*Ermanno Pietrosemoli* is currently a researcher at the Telecommunications/ICT for Development Lab of the International Centre for Theoretical Physics in Trieste, Italy, and President of Fundación Escuela Latinoamericana de Redes, “EsLaRed”, a non-profit organization that promotes ICT in Latin America through training and development projects. EsLaRed was awarded the 2008 Jonathan B.Postel Service Award by the Internet Society.

Ermanno has been deploying wireless data communication networks focusing on low cost technology, participating in the planning and building of wireless data networks in Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador, Italy, Lesotho, Malawi, Mexico, Micronesia, Morocco, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Peru, Trinidad, U.S.A., Venezuela and Zambia. He has presented in many conferences, published several papers related to wireless data communication, and is coauthor and technical reviewer of the (freely available) book http://wndw.net[“Wireless Networking for the Developing World”]. Ermanno holds a Master’s degree from Stanford University and was Professor of Telecommunications at Universidad de los Andes in Venezuela from 1970 to 2000.
