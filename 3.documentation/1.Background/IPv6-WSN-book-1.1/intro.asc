== The Internet of Things (IoT)

Building upon a complex network connecting billions of devices and
humans into a multi-technology, multi-protocol and multi-platform
infrastructure, the Internet-of-Things (IoT) main vision is to create
an intelligent world where the physical, the digital and the virtual are
converging to create smart environments that provide more intelligence
to the energy, health, transport, cities, industry, buildings and many
other areas of our daily life.

The expectation is that of interconnecting millions
of islands of smart networks enabling access to the information not only
“anytime” and “anywhere” but also using “anything” and “anyone” ideally
through any “path”, “network” and “any service”. This will be achieved
by having the objects that we manipulate daily to be outfitted with
sensing, identification and positioning devices and endowed with an IP
address to become smart objects, capable of communicating with not only
other smart objects but also with humans with the expectation of
reaching areas that we could never reach without the advances made in
the sensing, identification and positioning technologies.

While being globally discoverable and queried, these smart objects can similarly
discover and interact with external entities by querying humans,
computers and other smart objects. The smart objects can also obtain
intelligence by making or enabling context related decisions taking
advantage of the available communication channels to provide information
about themselves while also accessing information that has been aggregated by
other smart objects.

As revealed by Figure 1, the IoT is the new essential infrastructure
which is predicted to connect 50 billion of smart objects in 2020 when
the world population will reach 7.6 billion. As suggested by the ITU,
such essential infrastructure will be built around a multi-layered
architecture where the smart objects will be used to deliver different
services through the four main layers depicted by Figure 2: a device
layer, a network layer, a support layer and the application layer.

In the device layer lie devices (sensors, actuators, RFID devices) and
gateways used to collect the sensor readings for further processing
while the network layer provides the necessary transport and networking
capabilities for routing the IoT data to processing places. The support
layer is a middleware layer that serves to hide the
complexity of the lower layers to the application layer and provide
specific and generic services such as storage in different forms
(database management systems and/or cloud computing systems) and many
other services such as translation.

As depicted in Figure 3, the IoT can be perceived as an infrastructure
driving a number of applications services which are enabled by a number
of technologies. Its application services expand across many domains
such as smart cities, smart transport, smart buildings, smart energy,
smart industry and smart health while it is enabled by different
technologies such as sensing, nanoeletronics, wireless sensor network
(WSN), radio frequency identification (RFID), localization, storage and
cloud. The IoT systems and applications are designed to provide
security, privacy, safety, integrity, trust, dependability,
transparency, anonymity and are bound by ethics constraints.

Experts say we are heading towards what can be called a "ubiquitous
network society", one in which networks and networked devices are
omnipresent. RFID and wireless sensors promise a world of networked and
interconnected devices that provide relevant content and information
whatever the location of the user. Everything from tires to toothbrushes
will be in communications range, heralding the dawn of a new era, one
in which today’s Internet (of data and people) gives way to tomorrow’s
Internet of Things.

At the dawn of the Internet revolution, users were
amazed at the possibility of contacting people and information across
the world and across time zones. The next step in this technological
revolution (connecting people any-time, anywhere) is to connect
inanimate objects to a communication network. This vision underlying the
Internet of things will allow the information to be accessed not only "anytime" and "anywhere" but also
by "anything". This will be facilitated by using WSNs and RFID tags
to extend the communication and monitoring potential of the network of
networks, as well as the introduction of computing power in everyday items
such as razors, shoes and packaging.

WSNs are an early form of ubiquitous information and communication networks. They are one of
building blocks of the Internet of things.


*Wireless Sensor Networks*

A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is a self-configuring network of small
sensor nodes (so-called motes) communicating among them using radio
signals, and deployed in quantity to sense the physical world.
Sensor nodes are essentially small computers with extremely basic
functionality. They consist of a processing unit with limited
computational power and limited memory, a radio communication device,
a power source and one or more sensors.

Motes come in different sizes and shapes, depending on their foreseen use. They can be very small, if
they are to be deployed in big numbers and need to have little visual
impact. They can have a rechargeable battery power source if they are to
be used in a lab. The integration of these tiny, ubiquitous electronic
devices in the most diverse scenarios ensures a wide range of
applications. Some of the application areas are environmental
monitoring, agriculture, health and security.

In a typical application, a WSN is scattered in a region where it is meant to collect data through
its sensor nodes. These networks provide a bridge between the physical
world and the virtual world. They promise unprecedented abilities to
observe and understand large scale, real-world phenomena at a fine
spatio-temporal resolution. This is so because one deploys sensor nodes
in large numbers directly in the
field, where the experiments take place. All motes are composed of five
main elements as shown below:


. Processor: the task of this unit is to process locally sensed
information and information sensed by other devices. At present the
processors are limited in terms of computational power, but given
Moore’s law, future devices will come in smaller sizes, will be more
powerful and consume less energy. The processor can run in different
modes: sleep is used most of the time to save power, idle is used when
data can arrive from other motes, and active is used when data is sensed
or sent to / received from other motes.
. Power source: motes are meant to be deployed in various environments,
including remote and hostile regions so they must use little power.
Sensor nodes typically have little energy storage, so networking
protocols must emphasize power conservation. They also must have
built-in mechanisms that allow the end user the option
of prolonging network lifetime at the cost of lower throughput. Sensor
nodes may be equipped with effective power scavenging methods, such as
solar cells, so they may be left unattended for months, or years. Common
sources of power are rechargeable batteries, solar panels and
capacitors.
. Memory: it is used to store both programs (instructions executed by
the processor) and data (raw and processed sensor measurements).
. Radio: WSN devices include a low-rate, short-range wireless radio.
Typical rates are 10-100 kbps, and range is less than 100 meters. Radio
communication is often the most power-intensive task, so it is a must to incorporate energy-efficient techniques such as wake-up modes.
Sophisticated algorithms and protocols are employed to address the
issues of lifetime maximization, robustness and fault tolerance.
. Sensors: sensor networks may consist of many different types of
sensors capable of monitoring a wide variety of ambient conditions.
Table 1 classifies the three main categories of sensors based on
field-readiness and scalability. While scalability reveals if the
sensors are small and inexpensive enough to scale up to many distributed
systems, the field-readiness describes the sensor's engineering
efficiency with relation to field deployment. In terms of the
engineering efficiency, Table 1 reveals high field-readiness for most
physical sensors and for a few chemical sensors since most
chemical sensors lie in the medium and low levels, while biological sensors
have low field-readiness.

Common applications include the sensing of temperature, humidity, light,
pressure, noise levels, acceleration, soil moisture, etc. Due to
bandwidth and power constraints, devices primarily support
low-data-units with limited computational power and limited rate of
sensing. Some applications require multi-mode sensing, so each device
may have several sensors on board.


Following is a short description of the technical characteristics of
WSNs that make this technology attractive.


. *Wireless Networking*: motes communicate with each other via radio in
order to exchange and process data collected by their sensing unit. In
some cases, they can use other nodes as relays, in which case the
network is said to be multi-hop. If nodes communicate only directly with
each other or with the gateway, the network is said to be single-hop.
Wireless connectivity allows to retrieve data in real-time from locations
that are difficult to access. It also makes the monitoring system less
intrusive in places where wires would disturb the normal operation of
the environment to monitor. It reduces the costs of installation: it has
been estimated that wireless technology could eliminate up to 80 % of
this cost.
. *Self-organization*: motes organize themselves into an ad-hoc network,
which means they do not need any pre-existing infrastructure. In WSNs,
each mote is programmed to run a discovery of its neighborhood, to
recognize which are the nodes that it can hear and talk to over its
radio. The capacity of organizing spontaneously in a network makes them
easy to deploy, expand and maintain, as well as resilient to the failure
of individual points.
. *Low-power*: WSNs can be installed in remote locations where power
sources are not available. They must therefore rely on power given by
batteries or obtained by energy harvesting techniques such as solar
panels. In order to run for several months of years, motes must use
low-power radios and processors and implement power efficient schemes.
The processor must go to sleep mode as long as possible, and the
Medium-Access layer must be designed accordingly. Thanks to these
techniques, WSNs allow for long-lasting deployments in remote locations.

*Applications of Wireless Sensor Networks*

The integration of these tiny, ubiquitous electronic devices in the most
diverse scenarios ensures a wide range of applications. Some of the most
common application areas are environmental monitoring, agriculture,
health and security. In a typical application, a WSN  include:

. Tracking the movement of animals. A large sensor network has been
deployed to study the effect of micro climate factors in habitat
selection of sea birds on Great Duck Island in Maine, USA. Researchers
placed their sensors in burrows and used heat to detect the presence of
nesting birds, providing invaluable data to biological
researchers. The deployment was heterogeneous in that it employed burrow
nodes and weather nodes.
. Forest fire detection. Since sensor nodes can be strategically
deployed in a forest, sensor nodes can relay the exact origin of the
fire to the end users before the fire is spread uncontrollable.
Researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, demonstrated
the feasibility of sensor network technology in a fire environment
with their FireBug application.
. Flood detection. An example is the ALERT system deployed in the US. It
uses sensors that detect rainfall, water level and weather conditions.
These sensors supply information to a centralized database system.
. Geophysical research. A group of researchers from Harvard deployed a
sensor network on an active volcano in South America to monitor seismic
activity and similar conditions related to volcanic eruptions.
. Agricultural applications of WSN include precision agriculture and
monitoring conditions that affect crops and livestock. Many of the
problems in managing farms to maximize production while achieving
environmental
goals can only be solved with appropriate data. WSN can also be used in
retail control, particularly in goods that require being maintained
under controlled conditions (temperature, humidity, light intensity, etc) [SusAgri].

. An application of WSN in security is predictive maintenance. BP’s Loch
Rannoch project developed a commercial system to be used in refineries.
This system monitors critical rotating machinery to evaluate operation
conditions and report when wear and tear is detected. Thus one can
understand how a machine is wearing and perform predictive maintenance.
Sensor networks can be used to detect chemical agents in the air and
water. They can also help to identify the type, concentration and
location of pollutants.
. An example of the use of WSN in health applications is the Bi-Fi,
embedded system architecture for patient monitoring in hospitals and
out-patient care. It has been conceived at UCLA and is based on the
SunSPOT architecture by Sun. The motes measure high-rate biological data
such as neural signals, pulse oximetry and electrocardiographs. The data
is then interpreted, filtered, and transmitted by the motes to enable
early warnings.


*Roles in a Wireless Sensor Network*

Nodes in a WSN can play different roles.


. Sensor nodes are used to sense their surroundings and transmit the
sensor readings to a sink node, also called "base station". They are
typically equipped with different kinds of sensors. A mote is endowed
with on-board processing, communication capabilities and sensing
capabilities.
. Sink nodes or "base stations" are tasked to collect
the sensor readings of the other nodes and pass these readings to a
gateway to which they are directly connected for further
processing/analysis. A sink node is endowed with minimal on-board
processing and communication capabilities but does not have sensing
capabilities.
. Actuators are devices which are used to control the environment, based
on triggers revealed by the sensor readings or by other inputs. An actuator may have the same configuration as a mote but it
is also endowed with controlling capabilities, for example to switch a light on
under low luminosity.

Gateways often connected to sink nodes and are usually
fed by a stable power supply since they consume considerable energy. These entities are normal computing
devices such as laptops, notebooks, desktops, mobile phones or other
emerging devices which are able to store, process and route the sensor
readings to the processing place. However, they may not be endowed with
sensing capabilities. Being range-limited, sensor motes require
multi-hop communication capabilities to allow: 1) spanning distances much larger than the transmission range
of a single node through localized communication between neighbor nodes
2) adaptation to network changes, for example, by routing around a
failed node using a different path in order to improve performance and
3) using less transmitter power as a result of the shorter distance to be spanned by each node.
They are deployed
in three forms : (1) Sensor node used to sense the environment (2) Relay
node used as relay for the sensor readings received from other nodes
and (3) Sink node also often called base station which is connected to a
gateway (laptop, tablet, iPod, Smart phone, desktop) with higher energy budget
capable of either processing the sensor readings locally or to transmit
these readings to remote processing places.
